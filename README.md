# Memento Shopping Cart

*Important Note: This is a side project made for learning and implementing new things.*

*Project under development*

An app that allows users to create shops and items, which then can be bought.
My main goal for this app is to create a better user experience while shopping various things,
but mostly to implement new things and to tests new grounds in Front end dev.

The original idea was to implement a memento-like buying, so that the users have
a state of their shopping, and can go back and forth that state, but I postponed
the brainstorming for later, when I have to implement the shopping feature.

Until I change the version from v0.0.1, please don't use this as a learning guide
or whatever idea you may have, because I do not intend to write everything modular
until a later version.
